Hi! Iâ€™m Bo Hanssen, a technology-agnostic developer since 2015 and currently working as a solution architect at APG.
This space is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and interests, ranging from software development to personal
reflections.

Here, I share my journey through the world of technology and my continuous quest for knowledge. Feel free to wander
through my thought garden and discover new connections.

> **Note:** At the moment, I'm fiddling around
> with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz),
> and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to get it technically up and running. Once there's something to show, this
> space will replace the [Ghost](https://ghost.org) server currently hosting my blog
> at [bohanssen.com](https://bohanssen.com).
